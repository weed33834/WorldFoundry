"""
This module serves as a central entry point for various synthesis components
within the WorldFoundry pipelines. It implements a lazy-loading mechanism for its
public API, allowing components like `ActionModelSynthesis` to be accessed directly
from the `synthesis` package without being eagerly imported at startup.
This approach improves application startup time and helps manage potential
circular dependencies by only importing modules when their contents are first
accessed.

    Implements lazy loading for top-level attributes of this module.

    When an attribute `name` is accessed that is listed in `_EXPORTS` but
    has not yet been loaded, this method dynamically imports the
    corresponding submodule and retrieves the attribute from it.
    Once loaded, the attribute is cached in the module's `globals()`
    for direct access on subsequent requests, avoiding repeated imports
    and `__getattr__` calls for that specific attribute.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the attribute being accessed (e.g., 'ActionModelSynthesis').

    Returns:
        Any: The value of the requested attribute from the imported submodule.

    Raises:
        AttributeError: If `name` is not found in the recognized `_EXPORTS` dictionary,
                        indicating it's not a known lazily loadable attribute.
