            save_mode: The method to save outputs: "video" (default) for an MP4,
                       or "image" for individual PNG frames.
            fps: Frames per second, used when `save_mode` is "video".
            return_dict: If True, returns a dictionary containing frames and paths.
                         If False, returns only the list of generated NumPy frames.
            seed: An optional integer seed for reproducibility. If provided,
                  random states for `random`, `numpy`, and `torch` will be set.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, currently ignored (`del kwargs`).

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing generated frames, video path, and image paths
            if `return_dict` is True, otherwise a list of generated NumPy image arrays.

            ValueError: If `frame_conditions` is empty.
