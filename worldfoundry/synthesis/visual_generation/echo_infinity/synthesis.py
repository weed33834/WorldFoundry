"""Module for defining the EchoInfinitySynthesis integration within the runtime video synthesis framework.

This module provides the `EchoInfinitySynthesis` class, which serves as a concrete
implementation of `RuntimeVideoSynthesis` specifically tailored for the
EchoInfinity text-to-video generation model. It handles the dynamic loading
of the EchoInfinity runtime and specifies its configuration parameters.
