"""Provides a mechanism for lazy loading of the `InspatioWorldSynthesis` class.

This module primarily exposes `InspatioWorldSynthesis` via its `__getattr__` hook,
ensuring that the class is only imported when explicitly accessed. This approach
can help improve startup performance by deferring imports until they are truly
needed.
