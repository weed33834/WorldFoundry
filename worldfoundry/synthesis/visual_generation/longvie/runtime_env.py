"""
This module provides utility functions for resolving file system paths related to the LongVie project
and its dependencies, including base models like Wan2.1 I2V and UMT5 tokenizer, and control weights.
It handles various ways of specifying paths, including local directories, Hugging Face Hub (HFD)
repositories, and environment variable expansions, ensuring that the correct model assets are found.
It also manages Python's import resolution path (`sys.path`) for specific LongVie runtime components.
