Provides a high-level interface for the Allegro runtime environment.

This module re-exports the main `Allegro` class and `preprocess_images` function
from the `worldfoundry_runtime` submodule, and offers a utility function to determine
the root directory of the Allegro runtime assets. It serves as an entry point
for interacting with the Allegro evaluation system.
