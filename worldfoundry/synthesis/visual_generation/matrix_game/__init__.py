"""
This module provides a dynamic import mechanism, allowing specific objects (e.g., classes, functions)
to be lazily loaded from submodules on demand.

It defines a mapping of user-facing names to their respective module paths. When an attribute
is accessed on this module that matches one of the defined names, the corresponding submodule
is imported, the requested object is retrieved, cached, and then returned. This avoids
eagerly importing all submodules when the main module is loaded.
