"""Provides an independent synthesis wrapper for the 'ltx2_3_i2v' model.

This module defines the LTX23I2VSynthesis class, which configures the
runtime environment for performing video synthesis using the LTX2_3
model specifically for image-to-video (i2v) generation. It inherits
from RuntimeVideoSynthesis to leverage a standardized interface for
model integration and execution.
