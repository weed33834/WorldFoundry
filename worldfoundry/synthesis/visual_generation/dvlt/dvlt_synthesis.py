"""
This module provides the DVLTSynthesis class, which acts as a synthesis adapter for the
DVLT (Depth Vision Language Transformer) runtime.

It allows for easy integration and usage of the DVLT model by inheriting from BaseSynthesis
and delegating calls to a DVLTRuntime instance. It also re-exports important constants
and functions from the underlying DVLT runtime module.
