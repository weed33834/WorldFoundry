"""
This module provides lazy loading for AC3DSynthesis and AC3DRuntime classes.

It uses the __getattr__ mechanism to import these classes only when they are first accessed,
optimizing startup time and resource usage for applications that may only use a subset
of the library's components.

    Implements lazy loading for module attributes.

    This special module-level function is called when an attribute is accessed
