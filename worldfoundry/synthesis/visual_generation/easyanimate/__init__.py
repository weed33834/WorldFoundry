"""This module provides the main entry point and utilities for interacting with the EasyAnimate runtime environment.

It re-exports key components from the `worldfoundry_runtime` subpackage, including the `EasyAnimate` class
for animating models, functions to resolve default model paths, and configuration paths.
It also defines a utility function `runtime_root` to locate the base directory for EasyAnimate runtime assets.
