"""
This module serves as a lazy loader for various WAN (Wide Area Network) synthesis functionalities.

It dynamically imports specific synthesis classes or functions from submodules
only when they are first accessed, improving startup performance
by avoiding unnecessary imports. The `__all__` variable defines the public API
exported by this package, while `_EXPORTS` maps these public names to their
respective submodule paths.
