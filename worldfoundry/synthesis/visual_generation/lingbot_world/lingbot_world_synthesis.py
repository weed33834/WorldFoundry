"""
Provides a synthesis adapter for the LingBot runtime, allowing integration into
a broader synthesis framework.

This module primarily defines the `LingBotSynthesis` class, which wraps a
`LingBotWorldRuntime` instance to provide a consistent interface for
performing synthesis tasks, such as predictions. It also re-exports
key components and constants from the `lingbot_world` module for convenience.
