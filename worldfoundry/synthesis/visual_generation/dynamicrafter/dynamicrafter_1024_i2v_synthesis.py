"""
Module for configuring and wrapping the DynamiCrafter 1024 i2v model for video synthesis.

This module defines a specialized class, `DynamiCrafter1024I2VSynthesis`,
which extends `RuntimeVideoSynthesis` to provide a specific configuration
for the `dynamicrafter_1024_i2v` model. It sets up various class attributes
to specify model details, generation type, and configuration paths,
allowing for standardized integration within a larger synthesis framework.
