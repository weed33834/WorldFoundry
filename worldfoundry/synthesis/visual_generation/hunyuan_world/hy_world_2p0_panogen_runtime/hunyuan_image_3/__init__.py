# HunyuanImage-3.0: A Powerful Native Multimodal Model for T2T, T2I, TI2T, TI2I
"""
HunyuanImage-3.0 Package

This package provides the implementation of HunyuanImage-3.0, a unified multimodal model
that supports multiple generation tasks:
- Text-to-Text: Text generation from text prompts
- Text-to-Image: Image generation from text prompts
- Text & Image to Text: Text generation from text and image inputs
- Text & Image to Image: Image generation from text and image inputs

The package uses lazy loading to optimize import performance and reduce memory usage.
