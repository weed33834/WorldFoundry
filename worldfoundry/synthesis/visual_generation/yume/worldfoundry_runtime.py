"""Adapters for integrating Yume runtime models with WorldFoundry.

This module provides an interface between the WorldFoundry framework and the
upstream Yume model code, which resides in the `yume_runtime` package.
It facilitates loading, distributed setup, sampling, and post-processing
of Yume models within WorldFoundry, allowing synthesis modules to remain
focused on their core logic.
