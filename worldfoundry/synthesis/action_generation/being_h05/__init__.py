    This function is part of Python's module attribute access mechanism.
    It intercepts attribute lookups at the module level. If the requested
    attribute is `BeingH05Synthesis`, it imports and returns it from the
    `being_h05_synthesis` submodule only when explicitly accessed.
    For any other unknown attributes, it raises an `AttributeError`.

        name: The name of the attribute being accessed.

    Returns:
        The requested attribute if it can be lazily loaded.

    Raises:
        AttributeError: If the requested attribute is not 'BeingH05Synthesis'.
