    r"""Rename state-dict keys via regex substitution.

    Each key is matched against ``mapping`` in insertion order; the first
    matching pattern is applied with ``re.sub``. Keys without a match pass
    through unchanged.

    Args:
        state_dict: Source state dict.
        mapping: ``{regex: replacement}`` pairs.

    Returns:
        New state dict with renamed keys; tensors are not copied.

    Examples:

      >>> mapping = {r"^blocks\.(\d+)\.attn1\.to_q\.(.*)$": r"blocks.\1.to_q.\2"}
      >>> remapped = remap_checkpoint_keys(state_dict, mapping)
