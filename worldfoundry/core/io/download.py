"""Atomic URL → local-file downloader with optional content validation.

Designed for runner-side asset fetches (I2V first frames, demo prompts,
etc.) where the alternative -- bundling the file inside the installed
package -- breaks for non-editable / read-only installs. Cosmos and Wan
plugins both pull demo images from public URLs at first run.

    """Atomically download ``url`` into ``cache_dir / filename``.

    Streams the response into a sibling temp file (so ``os.replace`` is
    atomic on the same filesystem), runs ``validator`` against the
    fully-written temp file, then publishes it to the final cache slot
    via ``os.replace``. A network hiccup, HTTP error, or validator
    failure leaves the cache slot empty so the next call retries cleanly
    instead of reusing a half-written file.

    Args:
        url: The ``http(s)://`` URL to fetch.
        cache_dir: Directory to download into; created if missing.
        filename: Destination filename within ``cache_dir``. Defaults to
            the last path component of ``url``, or
            ``"downloaded_file.bin"`` if the URL has no path component.
        validator: Optional callable receiving the temp-file path; must
            raise on invalid content (return value is ignored).
            Typically a decoder check such as
            ``lambda p: media.read_image(str(p))`` so the consumer's
            decode is the source of truth for "valid".
        timeout: Per-request socket timeout in seconds.

    Returns:
        Absolute path to the cached file (existing or newly written).

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if the download fails, times out, or the validator
            rejects the response. The original exception is chained.
