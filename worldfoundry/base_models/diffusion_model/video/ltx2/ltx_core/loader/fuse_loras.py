#: Signature for a fuse callable used by :class:`FuseRule`.
#:
#: Args:
#:     key: The state-dict key being fused (e.g. ``"...layers.0.attn.q.weight"``).
#:     weight: The current value at ``key`` from ``model_sd``, on the fusion device.
#:     deltas: The pre-aggregated LoRA delta for ``key``, in ``aggregation_dtype``.
#:     model_sd: The full state dict, for rules that need companion keys
#:         (e.g. an existing ``.weight_scale``).
#:
#: Returns a dict of state-dict keys to overwrite -- at minimum ``{key: new_weight}``,
#: plus any companion keys (e.g. an updated ``.weight_scale``) the policy needs to
#: keep in sync.
