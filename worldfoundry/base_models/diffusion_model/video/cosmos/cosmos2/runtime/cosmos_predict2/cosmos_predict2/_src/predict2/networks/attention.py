# Description:
# Single point of entry for all generic attention ops (self and cross attention), that tries to
# deliver the best performance possible given any use case (GPU and environment).
#
# On Hopper GPUs (i.e. H100, H20, H200), Flash Attention 3 is the best-performing choice, but it
# needs to be installed. When it is not available, the second best choice is cuDNN attention, which
# we get using PyTorch's SDPA API.
#
# For all other use cases, we will just use PyTorch's SDPA, but we need to specify backends and
# priorities.
# Flash Attention 2, which is one of the backends, is the best choice for Ampere GPUs (both RTX and
# datacenter-class).
#
# For anything pre-Ampere, the only choice is "memory-efficient" (xformers) FMHA.
#
# For Ada and Blackwell RTX, it is unclear at the moment, so we defer to Flash Attention 2, and
# fallbacks are cuDNN and xformers.
#
# For Blackwell datacenter-class (B200, GB200), cuDNN is the best choice.
#
#
# Dispatching to the desired backends/paths are done by checking the compute capability (really SM
# number, which is just compute capability * 10) of the GPU device the input tensors are on.
#
# Here's a breakdown of relevant compute capabilities:
#
# | GPU / category | Arch  |
# |================|=======|
# | A100           | SM80  |
# | A40            | SM80  |
# | Ampere RTX     | SM86  |
# |----------------|-------|
# | Ada Lovelace   | SM89  |
# |----------------|-------|
# | H20            | SM90  |
# | H100           | SM90  |
# | H200           | SM90  |
# |----------------|-------|
# | B200           | SM100 |
# | Blackwell RTX  | SM103 |
# |----------------|-------|
