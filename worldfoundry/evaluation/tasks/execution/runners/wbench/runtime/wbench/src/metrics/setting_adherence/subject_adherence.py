"""
Subject adherence — VLM-based evaluation of subject appearance and action.

Method:
1. Extract Turn-1 frames from the video (sampled at 2fps)
2. Ask VLM to evaluate two aspects:
   - Subject Appearance Maintenance (1-5): How well the subject's visual appearance is maintained
   - Subject Action (0 or 1): Whether the subject exhibits the described action
3. Score = (maintenance / 5 + action) / 2

Requires:
- Split character prompt data (appearance_part + action_part per case)
- VLM API endpoint (OpenAI-compatible)

Evaluate the video on two aspects:

**1. Subject Appearance Maintenance (1-5)**
How well does the video maintain the subject's visual appearance (shape, color, clothing, equipment, category)?
Subject appearance: {appearance_part}

Scoring:
- 5: Subject appearance perfectly maintained throughout
- 4: Mostly maintained, minor visual changes
- 3: Some features maintained, noticeable changes
- 2: Few features maintained, significant appearance drift
- 1: Subject barely recognizable or completely changed

**2. Subject Action (0 or 1)**
Does the subject exhibit the described movement/action pattern in the video?
Expected action: {action_part}

- 1: The described action/movement pattern is clearly visible
- 0: The action/movement pattern is not visible or completely different

Answer in JSON format ONLY. Each reason must be within 20 words.
