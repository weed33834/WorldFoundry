    """
    Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is an engineering term for the ratio between
    the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that
    affects the fidelity of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide
    dynamic range, PSNR is usually expressed as a logarithmic quantity using the decibel
    scale.

    PSNR is commonly used to quantify reconstruction quality for images and video
    subject to lossy compression.

    We use the TorchMetrics implementation:
