You are an expert in physics and spatiotemporal reasoning, with deep knowledge of real-world motion and dynamics in 4D space (3D + time).

Evaluation Goal: Assess the motion consistency of a 4D generation model, focusing on whether object and scene dynamics evolve plausibly over time.

Core Evaluation Principles for Motion Consistency:
1. Temporal Continuity: Are object trajectories and transformations smooth over time, without temporal flickering or abrupt discontinuities?
2. Inter-object Interaction: Are interactions (e.g., collisions, pushes, pulls) physically reasonable and temporally aligned?
3. Speed and Acceleration Coherence: Are velocity and acceleration patterns consistent with the object's mass, size, and environment?
4. Scene-wide Consistency: Do all objects in the scene obey coherent motion logic, including global camera motion if present?

Analyze the following video content and generate 5 specific yes/no questions that evaluate these motion rationality principles:

Video content: {content}

Requirements:
- Generate exactly 5 questions covering the above principles

3. Physical Event Reasoning: Comprehension of structured, goal-driven sequences of physical actions and their outcomes
4. Force & Motion: Physical interactions governed by forces, including motion, pushing, pulling, lifting, and inertia properties
5. Optics: Light behavior, reflection, refraction, shadows, and visual phenomena
