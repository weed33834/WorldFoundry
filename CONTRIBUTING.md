# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve WorldFoundry. Keep changes scoped, document public
behavior, and prefer manifests, task YAML, runtime profiles, and public CLI
commands over private scripts.

The detailed maintainer guide lives in
[`docs/fumadocs/content/docs/maintainers/contributing.mdx`](docs/fumadocs/content/docs/maintainers/contributing.mdx).
The test map lives in [`test/README.md`](test/README.md).

## Before Opening A Pull Request

- Keep the change scoped to one pipeline, benchmark path, CLI surface, or docs area.
- Do not commit checkpoints, generated videos, local caches, API keys, tokens, or credentials.
- State any GPU, API quota, checkpoint, simulator, official repo, or gated-data requirement.
- Run the focused tests or validation scripts relevant to the changed surface.
- Run `bash scripts/docs/build.sh --skip-bootstrap` when docs or README links change.
- Include scorecard, preflight, or validation evidence for any readiness claim.

## Change Checklists

### Add Or Update A Model

- Update `data/models/catalog/` and, when needed, `data/models/runtime_profiles/`.
- Declare aliases, source status, integration status, auth, checkpoint refs, license, and blockers.
- Add or reuse a public adapter target and a minimal validation command before claiming `integrated`.
- Keep API/GPU/checkpoint requirements out of quickstart defaults.
- Verify with `worldfoundry-eval zoo models --json` and focused model-zoo tests.

### Add Or Update A Benchmark

- Update `data/benchmarks/catalog/` and task YAML under `data/benchmarks/tasks/external/` when applicable.
- Declare dataset refs, auth, unsafe/gated data, official repo, simulator, metrics, and blockers.
- Add a contract adapter or normalizer before claiming `contract_ready`.
- Add official runtime evidence before claiming leaderboard validity.
- Verify with `worldfoundry-eval zoo benchmarks --json` and readiness tests.

### Add Or Update A Metric

- Add deterministic fixtures for metric correctness.
- Document whether higher is better, output units, primary metric status, and leaderboard mapping.
- Ensure scorecards expose the metric under stable keys.

### Add Or Update Docs

- Keep first-run docs CPU-only, no-download, no-token, and no-GPU.
- Link complex environment, official runtime, and API paths to reference docs.
- Run the docs build and docs checks.

### Add Or Update A CLI Argument

- Update `docs/fumadocs/content/docs/reference/cli.mdx` when public behavior changes.
- Preserve JSON output compatibility or document the breaking change.
- Add parser/UX tests for help, error handling, and no-heavy-import behavior.

## Synthesis Is Infer-Only

`worldfoundry/synthesis/**` packages upstream **inference** runtimes only. Do not add:

- training launchers, dataset builders, finetune scripts, or benchmark-only tooling
- demo media, generated outputs, checkpoints, or downloaded datasets
- notebooks, README files, or other documentation inside the synthesis tree

Put reusable demo assets under `worldfoundry/data/test_cases/`.

Before release or large runtime imports, run:

```bash
make synthesis-hygiene
make synthesis-hygiene-strict
```
